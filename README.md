# JAM Laundry Service Website/Application

## Description
We created a website/app that allows customers to place laundry orders online and track their progress.

### Motivation for development?
We wanted to create a website for customers to order/schedule professional dry-cleaning service, that can be picked up and delivered to your home.

### User story (Who can use this?)
-As a parent with messy children, I want to send my childrenâ€™s-stained clothes to the laundry service, so that I do not have to wash and iron their clothes after a long day.
- As a college student living in the dorms, I want to use an affordable laundry service, so that I can focus on my studies.


## Usage
- Currently the web page will login if any username is typed in with any password
- The Username is used as a First name of the customer and it is considered as a working profile
- The Login page will take you to the create order page where a user can select the item that needs to be cleaned, the type of service that is required (i.e. delivered or self/service) and the date expected to finish.
- The create order page, will take you to the order status page, where the items list can be displayed based.
- There are two lists in the orders page (1- one will show a table of the active items having a status of "in-progress /or/ Completed" and another table with the completed orders.
- You can click on the button "picked-up?" to move a completed item from the active list to the completed orders list.
